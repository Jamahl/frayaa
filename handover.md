## Project Status (as of 2025-06-14)

### Current Objective
Finalize and test the refactored CrewAI multi-agent workflow for meeting-related email processing, Google Calendar integration, and user preference management via a Next.js dashboard.

---

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. **Preferences Form (Frontend/Backend Integration)**
- **Problem:** The preferences page at `/dashboard/preferences` fails to load user preferences, showing a "Failed to fetch" error.
- **Root Cause:** The Django backend API at `/api/user/preferences/<user_id>/` returns a 500 Internal Server Error for the real Supabase user ID (`6a9bda06-7325-4421-9b7f-532defcc2928`).
- **Debug Steps Taken:**
  - Verified the Next.js proxy config (`next.config.js`) correctly forwards requests to Django on port 8001.
  - Updated the frontend to use a real Supabase user ID.
  - Checked Django logs; error is from a Supabase query (likely no matching row or schema mismatch).
  - Confirmed Supabase table `preferences` exists and is referenced correctly in Django code.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Verify that a row exists in `preferences` for the real user ID (`6a9bda06-7325-4421-9b7f-532defcc2928`).
  - Check column names and data types in Supabase match what the Django API expects.
  - Add robust error logging to Django for clearer frontend error messages.

### 2. **API Connection Issues**
- Proxy and routing are now correct; all errors are backend (Django/Supabase) related.

## Remaining Testing & Features

### 1. **Preferences Form**
- Confirm successful fetch and update of preferences for a real user.
- Test form validation and error handling.

### 2. **Calendar Integration**
- Test all CrewAI tools for Google Calendar:
  - Search events
  - Book events
  - Reschedule events
  - Cancel events
- Ensure integration works with real user preferences.

### 3. **Email Polling & Processing**
- Run the refactored `poll_gmail.py` script.
- Test with various email scenarios:
  - Meeting requests
  - Reschedule/cancel requests
  - Non-meeting emails
  - Direct user commands
- Confirm correct intent detection, calendar actions, and email replies.

### 4. **End-to-End Flow**
- Validate that user preferences from the dashboard are respected in meeting scheduling.
- Confirm emails are sent and calendar events are managed as expected.

## Summary
- **Frontend and backend are connected, but backend 500 errors block preferences form.**
- **Focus:** Fix Supabase data for the real user, then retest the preferences page.
- **Next:** Complete end-to-end testing for calendar and email workflows.

For further debugging, start by verifying Supabase data and Django API error logs.
